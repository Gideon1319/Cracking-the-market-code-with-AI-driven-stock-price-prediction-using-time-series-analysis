📈 Cracking the Market Code: AI-Driven Stock Price Prediction Using Time Series Analysis

This project explores the application of artificial intelligence and time series analysis techniques for predicting stock prices. Leveraging historical stock data, we implement and compare various AI models—including LSTM, ARIMA, and Prophet—to uncover market trends and forecast future price movements.

🔍 Key Features:

* Time series preprocessing and visualization
* Implementation of traditional and deep learning models
* Model performance comparison and evaluation metrics
* Interactive plots for trend analysis
* Scalable and modular code structure

🛠️ Technologies Used:

* Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras
* Facebook Prophet, statsmodels
* Jupyter Notebook

📊 Use Cases:

* Financial forecasting
* Quantitative research
* Algorithmic trading support
